/*
Package pusher is the Golang library for interacting with the Pusher HTTP API.

This package lets you trigger events to your client and query the state
of your Pusher channels. When used with a server, you can validate Pusher
webhooks and authenticate private- or presence-channels.

In order to use this library, you need to have a free account
on http://pusher.com. After registering, you will need the application
credentials for your app.

Getting Started

To create a new client, simply pass in your application credentials to a `pusher.Client` struct:

	pusherClient := pusher.Client{
	  AppID: "your_app_id",
	  Key: "your_app_key",
	  Secret: "your_app_secret",
	}

To start triggering events on a channel, we simply call `pusherClient.Trigger`:

	data := map[string]string{"message": "hello world"}

	// trigger an event on a channel, along with a data payload
	pusherClient.Trigger("test_channel", "event", data)

Read on to see what more you can do with this library, such as
authenticating private- and presence-channels, validating Pusher webhooks,
and querying the HTTP API to get information about your channels.
